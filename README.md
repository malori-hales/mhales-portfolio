Analyzing Historical Plane Crash Data with Python

By Malori Hales

With recent media focus on aircraft types and their possible effect on flight safety, I thought that it would be beneficial to obtain and analyze plane crash data to see if there is a noticeable increase in plane crashes over time, or if there are any factors which contribute to plane crashes occuring. In this notebook, I explore, manipulate, and illustrate data containing all recorded plane crashes since 1908.
